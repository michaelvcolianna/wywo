# WYWO (While You Were Out)

Embarrassing code I wrote for the Genius Room server when I worked at an Apple Store. I set the server up to run a LAMP stack and used it to make the lives of my coworkers a little easier where I could â€“ this note-taking app, a scheduling app, and a checkin app to help manage the insane flow of customers. They would later create their own scheduling app and the checkin app became the thing they use to sign you up for classes/Genius Bar/whatever now.

*master* contains the code as-is.
*develop* contains the code with some tweaks so it works in PHP 7.2.
*feature/refactor* is a silly pseudo-refactor. I'd framework a real refactor nowadays, but just wanted to mess around.
